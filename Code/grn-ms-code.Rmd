# Read mapping methods
For all samples, sequencing reads were then processed through the nf-core RNA-Seq pipeline (Di Tommaso et al. 2017; Ewels et al. 2020) built with Nextflow v20.10.0 (Di Tommaso et al. 2017) for initial QC and raw read counting. Reads were trimmed using Trim Galore! v0.6.5 (Krueger) and aligned to the W22 reference genome (Springer et al. 2018) using Hisat2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al. 2015) with default parameters (hisat2 -x $db $input -p 12 --met-stderr --new-summary). Uniquely aligned reads were counted per feature by featureCounts v2.0.1 (Liao et al. 2014). Raw read counts were normalized by library size and corrected for library composition bias using the TMM normalization approach in edgeR v3.28.0 (Oshlack et al. 2010), to give CPMs (Counts Per Million reads) for each gene in each sample allowing direct comparison between mutant and control samples (Table S1). CPM values were normalized by gene CDS lengths to give FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads) values (Table S1). Genes were considered expressed if their CPM was â‰¥ 1 in at least one sample per tissue.

#### Identification of DE genes for RNA-seq datasets/Tissue ###

To determine if any genes could be DE due to genetic differences between the control W22 r-g colorless and UniformMu color-converted W22 (McCarty et al. 2005), DE genes were called between all TF mutant allele and W22 samples from the same tissue. A small number of genes (n = 1773) that are consistently DE in more than half of the mutant alleles from imbibed embryo, tassel stem and seedling leaf tissues (tissues with < 50% of mutant reads from one TF gene) were removed. 

Removed genes that were called DEG between all mutant alleles and W22 in three tissues: imbibed embryo, tassel stem and seedling leaf tissues. Do not want to compare differences between genes that may be due to differences in background genotype and not from knockout out the TF.

# 3. Run DEseq2 on all mutant alleles x W22 control/ tissue, not each mutant allele x W22 separately.
 Using coleoptile tip as an example

1. Pre-filter low expressed genes
While it is not necessary to pre-filter low count genes before running the DESeq2 functions, there are two reasons which make pre-filtering useful: by removing rows in which there are very few reads, we reduce the memory size of the dds data object, and we increase the speed of the transformation and testing functions within DESeq2. Here we perform a minimal pre-filtering to keep only rows that have at least 10 reads total. # Pre-filtering http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html

keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]

2. Run DEseq, take res(dds) contrasts want
3. Filter DEG list: abs(log2fc) >=2, padj < 0.05

#### Identification of DE genes for RNA-seq datasets/Tissue ###
# Run DEseq2 on all mutant alleles x W22 control/ tissue, not each mutant allele x W22 separately.
See rn21a_contrast_nrdeg_freq_barplot.pdf

We do see the trend of greater overlap of the mutant_W22 DEGs with an increasing number of genes that are DE in more mutant alleles from the genotype_W22.

Thoughts on filtering based on these plots: 
A.  Either we filter out all of the DEGs called in the all mutants_W22 contrast/tissue
B.  We select which DEG calls of all mutant alleles x W22 in each tissue to trust based on the number of mutant alleles we analyzed/Tissue  e.g. in coleoptile_tip there are 4 alleles and 2 are from 1 TF versus Tassel, there are 3 alleles and 2 are from the same TF. 

Lets go with option B. 

For all tissues where n alleles < 50% of counts from 2 alleles/ TF remove DEGS from all mutants_W22 that overlap with previous Genotype_W22 DEG calls.
# embryo_imbibed, leaf, and tassel_stem
Leave tissues where mutants_W22 contrast is a small n and >=50% of the counts are coming from 2 alleles/1TF. May end up throwing removing specific alleles of this tissue altogether. 

Found that mutant_W22 DEGs/tissue increased overlap with # of genotype_W22 DEGs that were DEG in > # of mutants. This may be indicative of control W22 (reference) and mutant (UniformMu) W22 being different. 
Although we had a greater n of alleles for for ei and leaf tissues that were self only pedigree mutants - we do see more mutant_W22 DEGs overlap with genotype_W22 DEGs in more mutants (mutant_n) for these self pedigrees than tassel_stem (BC1S2 alleles)

```{r} 
tz = read_tsv(file.path(dirr, "rn21a_mutant_x_W22_degs.tsv"), col_names = TRUE)
va = tz %>% separate_rows(gid, w.gid, log2fc, padj, sep = ",")

# Final expressed gene list after filtering out all mutant x W22 DEGS (mw) in ei, lf, and ts tissues. 
dn = plyr::match_df(x5, vc, on = c("w.gid", "Tissue")) # remove only genes by gid and tissue because the filter degs between mw and expressed or not expressed were by tissue
# note: this removes genes from W22 control samples that were called DEG between all mutants and W22. this is what I want. do not want to compare differences between genes that may be due to differences in background and not from knockout out the tf.

# remove alleles we do not trust are knockouts

# 5. DEseq on all genes/tissue for each mutant allele (3 biological replicates) x W22 (3 biological replicates)

1. prefilter genes for low read counts
While it is not necessary to pre-filter low count genes before running the DESeq2 functions, there are two reasons which make pre-filtering useful: by removing rows in which there are very few reads, we reduce the memory size of the dds data object, and we increase the speed of the transformation and testing functions within DESeq2. Here we perform a minimal pre-filtering to keep only rows that have at least 10 reads total. http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html

keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]

2. Run DEseq, take res(dds) contrasts want
3. Filter DEG list: abs(log2fc) >=2, padj < 0.05
4. Calculate average cpm value across three replicates if not already done
5. Filter out lowly expressed genes after get final DEG list filtered. Expressed genes: avg. cpm >= 1 cpm in at least one samples/tissue
6. filter out DEGs from previous from previous DE analysis (all mutant alleles x W22/tissue in 3 tissues: imbibed embryo, tassel stem and seedling leaf)

Not necessary to filter requiring average CPM >=1 before running DEseq; however, it is a good idea to pre-filter based on raw reads.
Although DEseq2 does some low-variance filtering internally, the number of genes you feed into the algorithm do have an effect on the parameter estimation and final output (pvalues). DEseq2 encourages users to pre-filter their input read count matrix. It is recommended to remove genes where total read counts (summed raw read counts over all samples) is less than 10.

# DEseq matrix
Make a different DEseq matrix x each tissue. 
Design specifies how the counts from each gene depend on our variables in the metadata
For this dataset the factor we care about is our Genotype (design = ~Genotype)

Representation factor
The representation factor is the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent groups.
A representation factor > 1 indicates more overlap than expected of two independent groups, a representation factor < 1 indicates less overlap than expected, and a representation factor of 1 indicates that the two groups by the number of genes expected for independent groups of genes.

x = # of DEGs by direction (up or down) in common between two independent mutant alleles/TF.
n = # of DEGs/direction in group 1.
D = # of DEGs/direction in group 2.

### Enrichment for TF predicted targets ###

All statistical analyses for enrichment of DEGs utilized a hypergeometric probability. Testing for over-representation or enrichment of mutant allele DEGs for GO terms (File S4) or GCN predicted targets was calculated with R stats v4.0.2 hypergeometric phyper(q = x - 1, m, n = N - m, k, lower.tail = FALSE) function, p < 0.05 for significance (R Core Team 2020). For GO term enrichment: N = number of expressed genes associated with any GO term, m = number of genes with a specific GO term, k = number of DEGs with any GO term, x = number of DEGs with a specific GO term. For GCN (n1 and n3) predicted target enrichment: N = number of expressed non-redundant predicted target genes in the genome, m = number of expressed predicted targets per TF, k = number of DEGs, x = number of DEGs that are predicted targets. The fold-enrichment of GCN predicted targets that were DE was calculated by [x / (k / N) Ã— m].

# 2. Enrichment of TF DEGs as GCN predicted target genes continued ... 

Code for hypergeometric enrichment of how many DEG's were GCN predicted targets/TF from each network, n1 and n3. Use N (number of expressed total predicted targets/tissue - not just predicted targets from TF's of interest) calculated from above.
For GCN (n1 and n3) predicted target enrichment: N = number of expressed non-redundant predicted target genes in the genome, m = number of expressed predicted targets per TF, k = number of DEGs, x = number of DEGs that are predicted targets. The fold-enrichment of GCN predicted targets that were DE was calculated by [x / (k / N) Ã— m].

### Identifying TF binding sites in Y1H promoter cloned regions of MYB40 and HSF24 ###
No code. Description of reference input file for the 54 promoter B73.v4 coordinates cloned in the Y1H screen

Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) were identified in Y1H bait cloned promoter sequences of predicted targets (Yang et al. 2017) for two TFs, MYB40 and HSF24. The B73v4 maize genome was scanned for TFBS sequence of five R2R3 MYB TFs (AtMYB52, AtMYB59, AtMYB46, AtMYB111, AtMYB55) (Franco-Zorrilla et al. 2014) and a generic HSF TFBS (5' NGAANNTTCN 3') (Perisic et al. 1989), with N nucleotide weighting set to the GC content of maize genomic DNA to find significant matches (p < 0.01) (FIMO tool in the MEME suite (Grant et al. 2011)). These putative genome-wide TFBSs were then subset to Y1H bait promoter cloned regions for predicted targets of MYB40 or HSF24 to identify if these promoter sequences contained the respective TFBSs (BEDTools intersect (Quinlan and Hall 2010)). 

Input file y1h_54_pro.bed has the B73.v4 reference coordinates for the cloned sequences of all 54 promoters in the Y1H screen (Yang et al. 2017).

1. took +/- 2kb from 54 phenolic genes cloned in Y1H and scanned for known MYB40 and HSF24 TFBS
2. took only cloned regions of promoters (~1kb upstream, got actual coordinates of cloned sequence in B73v4 by using promoter sequences from v3/ gid from Yang et al. 2016)

1. The number of identified putative MYB and HSF TFBSs in the cloned region of each Y1H bait
2. The number of identified putative MYB TBFSs within +/- 2kb of the TSS

In the paper, we report results only on the motifs found within the cloned region of the MYB40 and HSF24 cloned bait.

### Morphological field measurements ###

For plant height and ear height (measured in cm), a t-test (unpaired, FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05) was performed on log transformed values between each mutant row and the combined W22 rows within a field to determine if the difference between means was significant (File S2).

2019 Field Phenotyping Data: plant height, ear height and flowering time data for 12/33 mutants + W22 control from the 2019 field season. t-test between each mutant and W22 

Flowering time - Cannot complete statistics, one data point/row. All flowered within X days from control and neighboring rows. 
Statistics on rows for difference in plant terminal height (cm) and ear height (cm) in X cm.

log transform data without normal distribution
Even though the distribution is not perfectly normal it looks much closer to the normal distribution than the previous histogram!

### Morphological field measurements continued... ###
No alleles with significance compared to W22 for PHT or EHT within each field, across both fields. 

Due to variance between fields comparing significance within fields and not an average across Fields/Genotype/Trait
See for PHT that W22 is significantly different between fields. No statistics including data from both fields, only within each field.

### Phenolic profiling with targeted LC-MS- Meatbolite data analysis ###

To determine if the mutant metabolite profile was significantly different from that of W22, an unpaired t-test (FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05) was performed on log2 transformed AUA values of 28 phenolic compounds between each mutant allele and control group: W22 r-g or UniformMu W22, and between control groups (File S3). The 4 phenolic compounds (Vitexin, Dihydroquercetin, Isoorientin, Kaempferol) that were significantly different between the control groups, W22 r-g colorless and UniformMu color-converted W22, were removed from the analysis to avoid false positives. In total, we could analyze data for 24 phenolic compounds. We only considered a mutant metabolite profile per compound to be significantly different from the control if there was statistical significance compared to both W22 controls: W22 r-g and UniformMu W22. 

Read in AUA + LOD Metabolite Data 
1. Across sub-batches are there 25% of samples < the LOD/Compound/sub-batch. e.g. If there are 2 sub-batches. 20 samples in batch 1/Compound 1. 5/20 are below LOD for batch 1. 20 samples in batch 2/Compound 1 and 5/20 are also below the LOD for batch 2. Total = 10/40. <25% of samples across sub-batches 1 and 2 for Compound 1 that are below the respective LOD's per sub-batch. Therefore, we do not remove this sample from the analysis. 
- pay attention to compounds for sure need to remove:Apigenidin, Apigenin-7-O-glu because there is no data for control W22 and W22_rg
2. Remove samples if Metabolite missingness > 10% across sub-batches. In batch 1 No data for Quercetin, Apigenidin, Phenylalanine 
2. log2 transform AUA values before calculating mean of any technical replicates/batch and then calculate the mean of biological replicates. log2(AUA + 1)
3. Impute / Convert NA values to 0
4. T-test. padj = fdr
